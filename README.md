This is the Github repo for Virtually Invisible Communications Protocol, a script for Space Engineers i've developed to hide antenna broadcasts.
I use this code in both [TrackOS](https://github.com/Lelebees/TrackOS) and [OmniTrack](https://github.com/Lelebees/OmniTrack) to hide the fact that a broadcast is being made.

Broadcasts are visible for a fraction of a second. Enough for someone to see it, but not nearly enough for them to act on it.
Use broadcasts sparingly!
