This is the Github repo for Virtually Invisible Communications Protocol, a script for Space Engineers i've developed to hide antenna broadcasts.
I use this code in both [TrackOS](https://github.com/Lelebees/TrackOS) and [OmniTrack](https://github.com/Lelebees/OmniTrack) to hide the fact that a broadcast is being made.

Broadcasts are visible for 3 ticks, which in ideal circumstances means a 5/100th of a second, or 50 miliseconds.
