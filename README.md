# VICP
This is the Github repo for Virtually Invisible Communications Protocol, a script for Space Engineers i've developed to hide antenna broadcasts.
I use this code in [TrackOS](https://github.com/Lelebees/TrackOS) to hide the fact that a broadcast is being made.

Broadcasts are visible for a fraction of a second. Enough for someone to see it, but not nearly enough for them to act on it.
Use broadcasts sparingly!

# ARCHIVE NOTICE
I'm archiving this repo. There's some serious issues with VICP that cause it to be hardly useable. I have something new and better in the works, which you might see appear in a year or so (I dont work that fast)
I've learnt a lot about programming and Space Engineers since this project and I want to showcase that in an improved version. In any case, it may be a while, and I won't be maintaining this repo anymore (not that it was necessary or I ever did, but hey)
